    - "libs/custom_sensor"  # Custom sensor definition for STM32 Internal Temperature Sensor raw values
#### TODO    - "libs/adc_stm32f1"    # Temperature sensor depends on STM32F1 ADC driver

# Initialisation functions to be called by sysinit() during startup.
# Mynewt consolidates the initialisation functions into sysinit()
# and calls them according to the Stage number, highest number first.
# Stage 500 is used by Sensor Creator so we use Stage 600 onwards.
# Generated sysinit(): bin/targets/bluepill_my_sensor/generated/src/bluepill_my_sensor-sysinit-app.c

pkg.init:
    # temp_stm32 should be initialised after stm32f1_adc (Stage 610)
    temp_stm32_create: 620  # Call temp_stm32_create() to initialise the internal temperature sensor driver during startup
