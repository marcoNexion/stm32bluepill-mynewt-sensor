# Initialisation functions to be called by sysinit() during startup.
# Mynewt consolidates the initialisation functions into sysinit()
# and calls them according to the Stage number, highest number first.
# Stage 500 is used by Sensor Creator so we use Stage 600 onwards.
# Generated sysinit(): bin/targets/bluepill_my_sensor/generated/src/bluepill_my_sensor-sysinit-app.c

pkg.init:
    # temp_stm32 should be initialised after stm32f1_adc (Stage 610)
    vdd_board_create: 630  # Call vdd_board_create() to initialise the internal vdd readings
