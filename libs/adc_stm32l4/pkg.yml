# Initialisation functions to be called by sysinit() during startup.
# Mynewt consolidates the initialisation functions into sysinit()
# and calls them according to the Stage number, highest number first.
# Stage 500 is used by Sensor Creator so we use Stage 600 onwards.
# Generated sysinit(): bin/targets/bluepill_my_sensor/generated/src/bluepill_my_sensor-sysinit-app.c

pkg.init:
    # stm32l4_adc should be initialised before temp_stm32
    stm32l4_adc_create: 610  # Call stm32l4_adc_create() to initialise the STM32L4 ADC driver during startup
